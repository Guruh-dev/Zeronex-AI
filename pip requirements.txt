I'll help you add new AI/ML libraries to your requirements.txt file. Could you please specify which new AI/ML libraries you want to add? Without knowing which libraries you want to add, I can't provide specific modifications to the file.

Some common additional AI/ML libraries you might consider are:
- keras
- xgboost
- lightgbm
- spacy
- nltk
- opencv-python

Let me know which libraries you want to add, and I'll help you integrate them with appropriate version requirements.
